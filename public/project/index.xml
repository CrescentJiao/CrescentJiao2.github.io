 --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the effects of integrating collaborative scripts into AR inquiry activities. Using learning analytics methods, such as cluster analysis, Lag Sequential Analysis, etc., to analyze students&amp;rsquo; collaborative inquiry performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üåü Project Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project investigates the influence of collaborative scripts and group interaction patterns on middle school students‚Äô collaborative inquiry outcomes in AR learning environments. It aims to understand how structured collaboration impacts knowledge acquisition and group dynamics in immersive educational settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üîç Research Objectives
1.	Examine the effect of collaborative scripts on group interaction and inquiry outcomes.
2.	Analyze group interaction patterns to identify collaborative behaviors that foster learning.
3.	Develop strategies for enhancing collaboration in AR-based learning activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
‚Ä¢	Data Collection: Pre-tests, group worksheets, post-tests, delayed post-tests, and video recordings of group activities.
‚Ä¢	Data Analysis: ANCOVA, t-tests for outcomes, and lag sequential analysis for interaction behavior patterns.
‚Ä¢	Assessment: Evaluated collaborative inquiry performance across five dimensions (knowledge understanding, role division, interaction participation, coordination supervision, and cooperation atmosphere).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üåü Project Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This joint research project, conducted in collaboration with Columbia University, Beijing Normal University, and East China Normal University, investigates how augmented reality (AR) can enhance students‚Äô representational fluency and self-efficacy in understanding linear functions. The project focuses on designing and evaluating AR applications to support mathematical concept formation and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üõ†Ô∏è Key Responsibilities
‚Ä¢	Developed 5 AR apps with varied design features to promote students‚Äô understanding of linear functions.
‚Ä¢	Conducted Design-Based Research (DBR) to iteratively refine the apps and assess their impact on student learning.
‚Ä¢	Collected and analyzed data, including:
‚Ä¢	Quantitative Analysis: Conducted ANOVA to examine differences in learning outcomes.
‚Ä¢	Qualitative Analysis: Coded interviews and reflective journals to uncover patterns in students‚Äô experiences.
‚Ä¢	Co-authored papers to disseminate findings and insights from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üí° Research Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project demonstrates how leveraging AR can foster representational fluency and build students‚Äô confidence in mathematical problem-solving. By combining innovative technology with evidence-based research, it contributes to the development of cutting-edge educational tools and pedagogical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
