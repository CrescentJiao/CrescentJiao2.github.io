    Jul. 2018 - Mar. 2019 (Principal Investigator: Dr. Xiao Hu)
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;üåü Project Overview&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This joint research project, conducted in collaboration with Columbia University, Beijing Normal University, and East China Normal University, investigates how augmented reality (AR) can enhance students‚Äô representational fluency and self-efficacy in understanding linear functions. The project focuses on designing and evaluating AR applications to support mathematical concept formation and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üõ†Ô∏è Key Responsibilities
‚Ä¢	Developed 5 AR apps with varied design features to promote students‚Äô understanding of linear functions.
‚Ä¢	Conducted Design-Based Research (DBR) to iteratively refine the apps and assess their impact on student learning.
‚Ä¢	Collected and analyzed data, including:
‚Ä¢	Quantitative Analysis: Conducted ANOVA to examine differences in learning outcomes.
‚Ä¢	Qualitative Analysis: Coded interviews and reflective journals to uncover patterns in students‚Äô experiences.
‚Ä¢	Co-authored papers to disseminate findings and insights from the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üí° Research Impact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project demonstrates how leveraging AR can foster representational fluency and build students‚Äô confidence in mathematical problem-solving. By combining innovative technology with evidence-based research, it contributes to the development of cutting-edge educational tools and pedagogical strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
