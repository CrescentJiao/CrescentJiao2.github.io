It aims to understand how structured collaboration impacts knowledge acquisition and group dynamics in immersive educational settings.\n🔍 Research Objectives 1.\tExamine the effect of collaborative scripts on group interaction and inquiry outcomes. 2.\tAnalyze group interaction patterns to identify collaborative behaviors that foster learning. 3.\tDevelop strategies for enhancing collaboration in AR-based learning activities.\n🛠️ Methodology •\tData Collection: Pre-tests, group worksheets, post-tests, delayed post-tests, and video recordings of group activities. •\tData Analysis: ANCOVA, t-tests for outcomes, and lag sequential analysis for interaction behavior patterns. •\tAssessment: Evaluated collaborative inquiry performance across five dimensions (knowledge understanding, role division, interaction participation, coordination supervision, and cooperation
