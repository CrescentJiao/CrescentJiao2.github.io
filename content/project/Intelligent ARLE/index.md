üåü Project Overview

Funded by the National Science Foundation of China, this project aims to develop intelligent AR learning environments that utilize multi-channel information fusion to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes, for example, designing AR applications than embeded visual, auditory elements to enhance students' learning.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Responsibilities
	‚Ä¢	Designed and developed AR applications to investigate their effects on learning outcomes.
	‚Ä¢	Designed an AR-data system to track student behaviors.
	‚Ä¢	Explored AI integration in AR systems to deliver automatic, context-aware feedback to learners.

üöÄ Research Impact

This project contributes to the development of intelligent educational environments, enabling adaptive learning experiences and real-time feedback that support student-centered instruction.
