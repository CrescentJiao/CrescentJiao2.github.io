Focusing on the effects of integrating collaborative scripts into AR inquiry activities. Using learning analytics methods, such as cluster analysis, Lag Sequential Analysis, etc., to analyze students' collaborative inquiry performance.


üåü Project Overview

This project investigates the influence of collaborative scripts and group interaction patterns on middle school students‚Äô collaborative inquiry outcomes in AR learning environments. It aims to understand how structured collaboration impacts knowledge acquisition and group dynamics in immersive educational settings.

üîç Research Objectives
	1.	Examine the effect of collaborative scripts on group interaction and inquiry outcomes.
	2.	Analyze group interaction patterns to identify collaborative behaviors that foster learning.
	3.	Develop strategies for enhancing collaboration in AR-based learning activities.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
	‚Ä¢	Data Collection: Pre-tests, group worksheets, post-tests, delayed post-tests, and video recordings of group activities.
	‚Ä¢	Data Analysis: ANCOVA, t-tests for outcomes, and lag sequential analysis for interaction behavior patterns.
	‚Ä¢	Assessment: Evaluated collaborative inquiry performance across five dimensions (knowledge understanding, role division, interaction participation, coordination supervision, and cooperation atmosphere).
